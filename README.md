# FaceRec
FaceRec is a facial recognition software that can identify and verify faces from images. It uses deep learning models and computer vision techniques to achieve high accuracy and speed.

## Features
- Face detection: Locate and crop faces from images or videos.
- Face alignment: Align faces to a standard pose and scale for better recognition.
- Face embedding: Extract features from faces using a pre-trained neural network.
- Face matching: Compare face embeddings and compute similarity scores.
- Face verification: Verify if two faces belong to the same person or not.
- Face identification: Identify the person who owns a face from a database of known faces.

## Installation
To install FaceRec, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher and pip installed on your system. Then, run the following command:

`pip install facerec`

This will install FaceRec and its dependencies, such as numpy, opencv, tensorflow, etc.

## Usage
To use FaceRec, you need to import the facerec module in your Python script. For example:

`import facerec`

Then, you can create a FaceRec object and use its methods to perform facial recognition tasks. For example:

`fr = facerec.FaceRec() # create a FaceRec object`

`img = fr.load_image("test.jpg") # load an image`

`faces = fr.detect_faces(img) # detect faces in the image`

`for face in faces:`

    `aligned_face = fr.align_face(face) # align the face`
    `embedding = fr.get_embedding(aligned_face) # get the face embedding`
    `name = fr.identify_face(embedding) # identify the face`
    `print(name) # print the name of the person`
